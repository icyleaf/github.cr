  class Client
    # Defines methods related to branch.

    # Every API call to issues must be authenticated.
    #
    # If a user is not a member of a project and the project is private, a GET request on that project will result to a 404 status code.

    # Issues pagination
    #
    # By default, GET requests return 20 results at a time because the API results are paginated.
